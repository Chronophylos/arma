# Operation Minotaur

Location: Malden
Date: 2007-04-16
Time: 1400

## Situation

The _Kingdom of Masere_ has occupied the small island of Malden with a small
but fierce offensive a week ago. Due to politial infighting the _Royal Marine
Defence Forces_ left the island shortly after the _Royal Ground Defence Forces_
have landed. And the _Royal Maseri Air Force_ have not yet departed for the
island. Because of that, there is no air coverage. _Maseri_ generals do not
expect a counter attack, especially not from the air.

## Task

Your task will be to destroy key facilities on the island. This includes radar
stations, fuel and equipment storage.

If you have some ammo left afterwards you're free to go after whatever you find.

## Enemy Assets

The enemy will have AAA as well as manpads and AH-21 Hornet Gunships. Due to
the distance to the mainland of _Masere_ you do not need to worry about QRF.

### AH-21 Hornet Gunship

A attack helicopter with AA capability. An easy target for a gun run or a Fox Two.
