# Operation Minotaur

Location: Malden
Date: 2007-04-17
Time: 0200

## Situation

The _Kingdom of Masere_ has occupied the small island of Malden with a small
but fierce offensive a week ago. Due to politial infighting the _Royal Marine
Defence Forces_ left the island shortly after the _Royal Ground Defence Forces_
have landed. And the _Royal Maseri Air Force_ have not yet departed for the
island. Because of that, there is no air coverage. _Maseri_ generals do not
expect a counter attack, especially not from the air. After we exploited this a
we got information about about a file that could completely cancel the _Maseri_
casus belli.

## Task

You will be inserted by submarine and have to dive to the port. From there you
will need to find the file that is somewhere located in the port.

## Enemy Assets

Mostly infantry. But if you make noise there will be a lot more infantry.
